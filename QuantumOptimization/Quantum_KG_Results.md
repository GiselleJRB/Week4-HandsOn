From Task 1, I used the synthetic graph to focus on task allocation, where the robot decides which task to perform. I extracted a subgraph that included 3 agents and 3 tasks, with binary variables that represent if a specific agent is assigned to a specific task (like agent 0 being assigned to task 1). The goal was to assign agents to tasks in a way that maximizes the total score, such as trust or priority, while also making sure that each agent only gets one task and each task is handled by only one agent.

I used Qiskit Optimization and DOcplex to generate the QUBO model. The objective function was minimized using scores, penalties, and slack variables. The binary variables explained what each agent was assigned to, and the constraints were encoded as penalties in the objective. Slack variables were added to enforce these constraints without explicitly writing them as hard rules. So, if a rule was violated, the QUBO would give a lower score for bad assignments, helping it find the best possible combination. The output showed a setup of 9 binary decision variables for the 3 agents and 3 tasks. The coefficients in the objective function represented priorities or penalties for each assignment. Overall, the code successfully encoded a real-world task assignment problem into a quantum-optimized form.

This relates to my research because, in disaster scenarios, robots are assigned critical tasks like rescue or delivery. Quantum optimization can help make these assignments faster and more efficient, especially under uncertainty or adversarial conditions.
